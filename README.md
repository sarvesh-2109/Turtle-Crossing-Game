# Turtle-Crossing-Game
Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Game, a fun and challenging project built in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this game, you control a brave turtle that needs to safely navigate a busy multi-lane highway filled with speeding cars.

## Gameplay

- Control your turtle using the "Up" arrow key.
- Dodge randomly generated cars as you move forward.
- The game becomes more challenging as you progress, with cars speeding up over time.
- If your turtle collides with a car, it's game over.
- Your goal is to reach the other side of the screen safely, increasing your level in the process.
